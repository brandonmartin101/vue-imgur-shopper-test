# vue-imgur-shopper-test
Example app. It uses Vue.js to query searches against the Imgur API. Default search is "the west wing". Image "Poster" price is based on the number of downvotes the image has received on Imgur.

The included Imgur API key is altered from my actual key. Grab a different key at https://api.imgur.com/endpoints.

There is no real-life application for this code. It's just for fun, and to help me learn Vue.js.
